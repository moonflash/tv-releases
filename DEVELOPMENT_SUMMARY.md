# TV Releases Import System - Development Summary

## Overview

This system implements a comprehensive daily TV releases import functionality using Rails best practices. It crawls TVMaze.com for upcoming TV show releases for the next 90 days and stores them in the database with intelligent channel matching.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Models

#### Channel Model (`app/models/channel.rb`)
- **Fuzzy name matching**: Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm to match similar channel names
- **Name normalization**: Automatically normalizes channel names (removes "Network", "Channel", etc.)
- **Special case handling**: Recognizes common networks like HBO, CNN, BBC, etc.
- **Uniqueness validation**: Prevents duplicate channels with case-insensitive matching
- **Associations**: Has many releases with dependent destroy

#### Release Model (`app/models/release.rb`)
- **Comprehensive validation**: Validates all required fields with proper error messages
- **Uniqueness constraint**: Prevents duplicate releases based on title, air date/time, season/episode
- **Scopes**: `upcoming` and `within_days` for flexible querying
- **Smart creation**: `find_or_create_from_crawl_data` method handles JSON data parsing
- **Channel association**: Optional belongs_to relationship with Channel

### 2. Services

#### ReleaseImportService (`app/services/release_import_service.rb`)
- **Paginated crawling**: Automatically crawls multiple pages until 90-day cutoff
- **Duplicate detection**: Intelligent skipping of already imported releases
- **Error handling**: Graceful error handling with detailed logging
- **Statistics tracking**: Returns import/skip/error counts
- **Date filtering**: Stops processing when releases exceed 90-day window
- **Channel integration**: Finds or creates channels for each release

### 3. Rake Tasks (`lib/tasks/releases.rake`)

#### `rake releases:import`
- Imports upcoming TV releases from TVMaze
- Provides detailed progress and result reporting
- Exits with error code if issues occur

#### `rake releases:cleanup`
- Removes releases older than 7 days
- Helps maintain database size

#### `rake releases:maintain`
- Runs both import and cleanup tasks
- Perfect for daily cron jobs

### 4. Database Schema

#### Channels Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Unique channel name
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

#### Releases Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `air_date`, `air_time`: When the show airs
- `title`: Show title
- `season_number`, `episode_number`: Season and episode
- `episode_title`: Episode title
- `channel_id`: Foreign key to channels (optional)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite

#### Model Tests
- **Channel**: 18 tests covering fuzzy matching, normalization, validations
- **Release**: 10 tests covering validations, scopes, creation methods

#### Service Tests
- **ReleaseImportService**: 18 tests covering all import scenarios, error handling
- **Existing Crawl4ai**: 1 test verifying integration

#### Rake Task Tests
- **All tasks**: 13 tests covering success/failure scenarios, output verification

**Total: 60 tests, all passing**

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Fuzzy Channel Matching
Implemented custom Levenshtein distance algorithm to handle variations in channel names:
- "HBO Network" matches "HBO"
- "Discovery Channel" matches "Discovery"
- Configurable similarity threshold (currently 0.8)

### 2. Duplicate Prevention
Two-layer duplicate detection:
- Database-level uniqueness constraint
- Service-level checking before creation
- Prevents unnecessary database calls and provides better statistics

### 3. Date/Time Handling
- Proper parsing of date strings from crawl data
- Time normalization to ensure consistent storage
- 90-day cutoff window implementation

### 4. Error Handling & Logging
- Comprehensive logging at all levels
- Graceful degradation on individual record failures
- Detailed error reporting and statistics

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Stops crawling when beyond date cutoff
- Efficient duplicate checking
- Optional channel relationships to avoid blocking
- Index on air_date/air_time for fast queries

## Usage

### Daily Automation
```bash
# Add to crontab for daily execution at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/app && bundle exec rake releases:maintain RAILS_ENV=production
```

### Manual Operations
```bash
# Import only
rake releases:import

# Cleanup only
rake releases:cleanup

# Both operations
rake releases:maintain
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Ollama LLM Integration**: Ready for enhanced channel matching if Ruby fuzzy matching proves insufficient
2. **API Endpoints**: Easy to add REST API for frontend consumption
3. **Notification System**: Framework ready for email/SMS notifications
4. **Caching**: Redis caching can be added for frequently accessed data
5. **Multiple Sources**: Architecture supports additional crawl sources
